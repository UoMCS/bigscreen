## @method $ init(%args)
# Initialise the BigScreen System's references to other system objects. This
# sets up the BigScreen-specific modules, placing references to them into the
# object's hash. The argument hash provided must minimally contain the
# following references:
#
# * cgi, a reference to a CGI object.
# * dbh, a reference to the DBI object to issue database queries through.
# * settings, a reference to the global settings object.
# * logger, a reference to a Logger object.
# * template, a reference to the system template engine.
# * session, a reference to the system session handler.
# * modules, a reference to the module loader.
#
# @param args A hash of arguments to initialise the System object with.
# @return true on success, false if something failed. If this returns false,
#         the reason is in $self -> {"errstr"}.
